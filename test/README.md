# Test Suite Summary

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for all CLI commands in the nestbox-ai-cli-tools project.

## Test Files Created

- **auth.test.ts** - Tests for authentication commands (login, logout)
- **projects.test.ts** - Tests for project management commands (project use, project add, list)
- **compute.test.ts** - Tests for compute instance management commands (compute list, create, delete)
- **document.test.ts** - Tests for document management commands (doc and collection subcommands)
- **image.test.ts** - Tests for image management commands (image list)
- **agent.test.ts** - Tests for agent management commands (agent list, remove, deploy, generate, create)

## What the Tests Cover

Each test file verifies:

1. **Command Registration** - Ensures all commands and subcommands are properly registered
2. **Command Structure** - Validates command names, descriptions, and hierarchy
3. **Options and Arguments** - Checks that expected command-line options are available
4. **Action Functions** - Verifies that action handlers are properly attached

## Test Strategy

The tests focus on **command registration and structure validation** rather than execution logic. This approach:

- Ensures the CLI interface remains stable
- Validates command-line argument parsing
- Verifies help text and descriptions
- Doesn't require mocking complex external APIs
- Runs quickly and reliably

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test auth.test.ts
```

## Test Framework

- **Vitest** - Fast unit test runner with TypeScript support
- **Commander.js** - CLI framework being tested
- **Mock Strategy** - External dependencies are mocked to isolate command registration logic

All tests are passing and provide confidence that the CLI command structure is working correctly.
